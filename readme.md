PostGIS and Rails _(the hard way)_
=================

PostGIS and Rails presentation by Ryan Dlugosz (@lbwski) for [Cincy.rb](http://cincyrb.com) in May
2015. Includes a brief introduction to PostGIS and a discussion of how to integrate it into a Rails app without the use of special gems or Active Record extensions.

See included [PDF of presentation](https://github.com/rdlugosz/postgis-and-rails/blob/master/PostGIS%20and%20Rails.pdf) and demo Rails app. A database dump has been
included for easy access to some geocoded tweets.
